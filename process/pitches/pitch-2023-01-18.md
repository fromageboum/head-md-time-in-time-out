A wearable device that interacts with you by playing music.
You can carry it with you, laid on your shoulder or resting
in the palm of your hand. But it is quite temperamental.
By travelling with it and testing different stimulations, you
will discover its boundaries and creativity. It will always let
you know how it feels by a really emotionnaly tinted melo-
dy, and after just a bit time you may be able to tame it.
