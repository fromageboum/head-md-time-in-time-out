# Tame your time

A wearable device shaped like a bird,that interacts with you by playing music. You can carry it with you, magneted on your shoulder or laid in the palm of your hand. This bird can be controled by any IR remote you can find, but it is quite temperamental. By travelling with it and testing different commands, you will discover its boundaries and creativity. It will always let you know how it feels by a really emotionnaly tinted musical outpout, and after just a bit time you may be able to tame it.
