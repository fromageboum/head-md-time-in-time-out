# Time Sequencers
Due date 2022-10-27 15:00

The direction i chose to take for my following research is the theme of « time sequencers », wich is the name i chose to refer to all the object, that have their own temporality. For example microwaves, washing machines, elevators, toasters. The time that is used for these objects are only depending of the time they need to function but is not really related to time in a large way. I want to pursue an investigation about how these time capsuled functionning objects interferes with time with a capital T.
