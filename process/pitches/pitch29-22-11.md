# Tame your Time

You found a strange device called the temporal MacGuffin. It interacts with you by playing music. But in order to do this, it needs you to charge it with time. You are choosing the amount of time you want to give to it, and collecting time to tame it's temporality so you can enjoy the music. Your symbiosis with it manifests through the musicality of it's output. It is really picky, it gets tired if you make it play too long, but frustrated if you don't let him express itself.  But it's quite an unreachable balance.
